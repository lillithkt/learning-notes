# Lillith's Learning notes

notes ive found useful working with new languages
all raw markdown files are found in [src/lib/notes](src/lib/notes/)


i heavily reccomend you get the [vscode-svx extension](https://github.com/sebsojeda/vscode-svx)

there are no builds available but its just `npx vsce package`

i put a prebuilt (with hash) at [my file server](https://serve.lilyy.gay/mdsvex)
